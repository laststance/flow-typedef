> **get Flow built-in type definition files.**

## Why
Flow Buit-in type definition files are hosted [facebook/flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow/tree/master/lib).  
If you would like to get those files some reason, [you have to manual copy](https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/922#issuecomment-146940723).  

## Getting Started
I Assume you have experience of [flow-typed](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed). Otherwise you might be start from [flow-typed](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed).  

## Install
**recommend global install**
```
$ yarn global add flow-typedef
```

## Usage
In the same directory as `package.json` that `flow-bin` installed(almost where is project root),
execute `flow-typedef` command. Then typedef files will be generated under the `flow-typed/built-in`.
```
# cd your-project-dir
$ flow-typedef
```

`flow-typedef` detect your flow-bin version and get same version typedef files.

And more, I reccomend following setting.

```js
// .flowconfig

[ignore]

[include]

[libs]

[lints]

[options]
no_flowlib=true

[strict]

```

Because Flow built in lib def already there in your `/flow-typed`.  
see option detail https://flow.org/en/docs/config/options/#toc-no-flowlib-boolean
